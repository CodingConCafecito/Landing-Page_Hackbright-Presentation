    <h1>My Coding/Debugging Challenges</h1>

      <p>Updating The Player's Progress</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="challenges-list">
          I used the "_" symbol to represent/display the letters in the mystery
          word
        </li>

        <!-- source: https://github.com/googlearchive/code-prettify -->

        <pre class="prettyprint language-python">
          <code>
  def play_game(mystery_word):
    mystery_word_display = "_" * len(mystery_word)
    print("Mystery Word:", mystery_word_display, "üîç")
          </code>
        </pre>

        <li class="challenges-list">
          It took many, many attempts to understand the logic of how I could
          replace the "_" symbol with a player's correct letter guess.
        </li>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
          <code>
    while not game_over and attempts_available > 0:
      elif guess in mystery_word:
      """ update the "_" with their correct letter guess ü§î """
          </code>
        </pre>

        <li>
          Eventually I was able to create a for loop that worked and one that I
          could understand and explain. üéâ
        </li>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-python challenge1-answer-code">
          <code>
        mystery_word_list = list(mystery_word_display)
        """ convert mystery_word_display to a list """
        for i, letter in enumerate(mystery_word):
          if letter == guess:
            mystery_word_list[i] = guess 
            """ if letter == guess, then at that index of this list, 
            the "_" is replaced with the letter guessed """
            mystery_word_display = "".join(mystery_word_list) 
            """ joins all the elements in the list """

      <p>Terminating the Program</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="challenges-list">
          After the user completes at least one round of the game, I wanted to
          call a function that would allow them to exit the program.
        </li>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-python challenge2-description-code">
          <code>
  def replay_game():
  """ asks player if they want to play again """
  def start_hangman():
  """ houses the functions that run the game """
    mystery_word = picking_mystery_word()
    introducing_game()
    play_game(mystery_word)
    choice = replay_game()

  start_hangman()
          </code>
        </pre>

        <li class="challenges-list">
          I kept running into the same bug: once the player choose to leave the
          program, they would be asked again if they wanted to replay. The
          program wouldn't break.

        <li>
          I was finally able to successfully debug when realized that if I
          wanted to outsource a part of the code to a different function outside
          of the main one that begins the program, I would need to be very
          specific with what it would return.
        </li>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-python challenge2-solution-code">
          <code>
  def replay_game():
    choice = input("Want to play again? Enter Y for yes or N for
    No. \n> ").upper()
      if choice == "Y" or choice == "N":
        return choice
      else:
        print("Please enter Y or N.")

  def start_hangman():
    while True:
    """ allows us to use break """
      mystery_word = picking_mystery_word()
      introducing_game()

      if choice == "N":
      """ dependent on what is returned from replay_game() """
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
